# Description

Assigns scrap components to loose object modifications, based on the crafting recipe.
Relevant for Weapon, Armor, or Robot mods.

Under Settings, you can set a "return factor", and which components to skip. 
The default factor is 0.75, this means, 75% of the amount of any crafting component will be included in the loose mod.
